# Get the Akeneo Extensions and their documentations

From the project console, you can access only the extensions developed by Akeneo.

The access to the extensions is shared with the [enterprise repository accesses](/articles/get-akeneo-pim-enterprise-archive.html), so you don't need to configure specific access for the extensions. 

* First from the menu, go to `Console / Project` and select your project.
* Go to `Extensions` tab, and you will see the list of all the extensions of your project.
* For each extension, the documentation link give the technical documentation to install the extension on your project.
