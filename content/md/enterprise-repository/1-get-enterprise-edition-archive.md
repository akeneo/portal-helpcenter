This document provides **step by step** instructions to obtain an **archive** of the PIM Enterprise Edition.

# Give access to the project Console

## The projects console

The **project console** is the place in your [Portal](connect-to-your-portal.html) where you can manage the access to your project like the Enterprise Repository and get the bootstrap archive. It can also used to configure your cloud instances and the support access. 

## Add developers to the projects console

**Supervisor** or **project manager** are the users who can give the authorization to work on Akeneo PIM project source code.

The users are allowed to access the **project console** are named the **console users**.

As a supervisor, you have the privilege to create **new users** on the portal and give them the **console user group** to be able to access the projects console. 
You can do it by going to `My Company / Contacts / Add Contact`, fill the form and select the `Console user` group and activate it by clicking on the red `X` in the user's list.

::: info
On a project, both customer or system integrator defined as an actor on the project are **autonomous** to give access to get the Enterprise Edition.
:::

## Access to the project on the projects console

If you have no access and if you are not a **supervisor** or **project manager**, you should contact that person to be listed under `Enterprise Repository / SSH Key Access` subtab. You can check who is the project manager on the `properties` tab of the Project and you can check who the Supervisor is in your company by going in `My Company / General Information` and under the section `Supervisors` you will see them listed.

* To access the Console, from the Portal, go to `Console / Projects`
* Choose the corresponding project
