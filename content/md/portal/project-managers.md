# What is a Project Manager?

Project Manager is a role that allows you to give access to the archive, manage clouds instance or get access to the support on a Project.
There are 3 kinds of Project Manager, depending of your company role on the project:

* As **Client Project Manager**, I can view and manage (add/remove) all the accesses on my project.
* As **Main System Integrator Project Manager**, I can view accesses from my company and from the Client company, and manage accesses only from my company.
* As **Tech Provider Project Manager**, I can view and manage accesses only from my company.

On a project, it needs to have at least one **Client Project Manager** and one **Main System Integrator Project Manager**.
