# What is a Project Manager?

Project Manager is a role that allows you to give access to the archive, manage cloud instances or reach the support for a Project.
There are 3 kinds of Project Managers, depending on your company role on the project:

* As a **Client Project Manager**, I can view and manage (add/remove) all the accesses on my project.
* As a **Project Manager from a Main System Integrator**, I can view accesses from my company and from the client's company, and manage accesses only from my own company.
* As a other **Project Manager**, I can view and manage accesses only from my own company.

For a given project, there must be at least one **Client Project Manager** and one **Project Manager from the Main System Integrator**.

# How to manage Project Managers
